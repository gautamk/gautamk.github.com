## Too many expectations

New Year huh ? A lot is expected of tomorrow. New year resolutions, Things are going to be better, Optimism, wishes blah blah. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a pessimist, neither am I an optimist. I just don't need another day to postpone things to. I'll start becoming better on Thursday, on Jan 1st. When was the last time new year resolutions worked ? 

## Why a holiday ?

Why is the first day of the year even a holiday ? If you expect the year to get better then its best to start now. 

## You know what I'm stopping right now. I'm going to go work !
